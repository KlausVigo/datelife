\title{Writes the node calibrations block for a MrBayes run file.}
\usage{
GetMrBayesNodeCalibrations(phy = NULL, ncalibration = NULL,
  ncalibrationType = "fixed", file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{The constraint tree: a phylo object or a newick character string, with or without branch lengths.}

\item{ncalibration}{The node calibrations: a phylo object with branch lengths proportional to time; in this case all nodes from ncalibration will be used as calibration points. Alternatively, a list with two elements: the first is a character vector with node names from phy to calibrate; the second is a numeric vector with the corresponding ages to use as calibrations.}

\item{ncalibrationType}{A character string specifying the type of calibration. Only "fixed" is implemented for now.}

\item{file}{A character vector specifying the name of mrBayes run file and outputs (can specify directory too).}
}
\value{
A set of MrBayes calibration commands printed in console as character strings or as a text file with name specified in file.
