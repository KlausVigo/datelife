\title{Makes a mrBayes run block file with a constraint topology and a set of node calibrations}
\usage{
make_mrbayes_runfile(constraint = NULL, ncalibration = NULL,
  missing_taxa = NULL, mrbayes_output_file = "mrbayes_run.nexus")
}
\arguments{
\item{constraint}{The constraint tree: a phylo object or a newick character string, with or without branch lengths.}

\item{ncalibration}{The node calibrations: a phylo object with branch lengths proportional to time; in this case all nodes from ncalibration will be used as calibration points. Alternatively, a list with two elements: the first is a character vector with node names from phy to calibrate; the second is a numeric vector with the corresponding ages to use as calibrations.}

\item{missing_taxa}{either a tree (as phylo object or as a newick character string, with or without branch lengths) with all the taxa you want at the end, or a data frame assigning missing taxa to nodes in dated tree.}

\item{mrbayes_output_file}{A character vector specifying the name of mrBayes run file and outputs (can specify directory too).}
}
\value{
A MrBayes block run file in nexus format.
